# Clarify Roles & Responsibilities

* Leaders at all levels ensure clearly defined roles and their responsibilities.
* Be sure roles help achieve the company vision and 1-year operating plan.
* Roles are accountable for specific results.
* Roles are not Jobs.
    - Jobs can be composed of 1 or more roles.
* Clarity about roles reduces waste due to people having overlap of work or conflict about who should do what.
* Clarify the level of authority they require in order to make decisions
* It is possible for multiple people to have the same role, depending on what they do.
* Enumerate the roles and tasks that are performed in business operations.
* Ensure roles needed by business processes are filled with the right people and no gaps.
* People may have many roles when the business is smaller, which may be spread to others as the business grows.
* Communicate the roles and responsibilities to the employees.
* Org charts typically show job titles, but can be enhanced by also showing roles
* Consider company goals when creating or updating roles.
* Determine what needs to get done. Ideally, trace roles to the value stream.

## Standard Work Traceability Elements
Most employees just want to know how to do the process. 
So we get right to it in the top part (above this section).
Rather than make every person wade through all the traceability information, we have moved it to the bottom, for the less frequent users like the Quality Manager, and Auditors.

* Helps backfilling a job when a person retires or leaves the company.

### Persons Affected

### Minimum Viable Process Requirements
>Auditable: These requirements may be audited for evidence they were met.

<li><input type="checkbox" checked disabled> As long as the following requirements are met, variation in the means to the end is okay for this process _(our default)_</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled> **Critical** process that requires step-by-step compliance</li>

1. Clear roles and responsibilities exist.
2. Each employee is made aware of what is expected of him or her.

### Terms & Definitions
A common language helps us all mean the same thing.
See the glossary at [url_link_goes_here](https://google.com). 
The first use of a new term is linked from here to that glossary.

job
:   A hired position composed of roles. A job title refers to that job position. For example, receptionist.

job description
:   Sums up the roles (functions) and responsibilities (results, tasks) of the person who will be holding the position.
Often describe the knowledge, skills and/or abilities (competencies) required.
Job descriptions have specific requirements for regulatory compliance.

job title
:   The label your employer has given you.

role
:   The **function** assumed or part played by a person in a business process or situation. 
A **set** of related responsibilities.
Think of a role as **a component of a job**.
Role names are descriptive of their set of responsibilities.
For example, a role of a receptionist is 'gatekeeper'.

>NOTE: Business processes that use roles instead of job titles have less change volatility during reorganizations.

responsibilities
:   The more detailed **specifics of a role**. 
The set of **specific results, behaviors or tasks** people are accountable to demonstrate in order to fill a particular role.
Defines the work that needs to be performed in a role an employee is accountable for.
Format: start with an active verb, describe the task, and the intended result or outcome.
The priority of the tasks depends on leadership's priorities.
Defined results help develop performance indicators for measurement and feedback.
