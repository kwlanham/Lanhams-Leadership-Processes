# Clarify Roles & Responsibilities

## Process Map
TBD - Include swim lane Diagram here.

## Procedure
See the [checkbox](#mvp-reqmts) to see if this procedure is only one way among others or required exactly.

### Inputs
* Roles needed to operate business processes

### Steps
1. Determine what needs to get done. 
1. Be sure [roles](#role-gloss) help achieve the company vision and 1-year operating plan.
1. Enumerate the roles and tasks that are performed in business operations.
1. Ensure roles needed by business processes are filled with the right people and no gaps.
1. Ideally, trace roles to the value stream.
1. Consider the roles needed to accomplish company goals when creating or updating roles.
1. Communicate the roles and [responsibilities](#responsibilities-gloss) to the employees.
1. Consider enhancing org charts, that typically show [job titles](#job-title), by also showing roles. 
1. Clarify the **level of authority** they require in order to make decisions.

### Outputs / Measurable Results
* Leaders at all levels ensure clearly defined roles and their responsibilities.

## Standard Work Traceability Elements
Many people just want to know how to do the process. 
So we get right to it in the top part (above this section).
Rather than make every person wade through all the traceability and auditable information, we have moved these things to the bottom, for the less frequent users like the Quality Manager, and Auditors.

### Purpose
People need to be clear on [roles](#role-gloss) and [responsibilities](#responsibilities-gloss).

### Business Value (_why it matters_)
* Clear [roles](#role-gloss) and [responsibilities](#responsibilities-gloss) enable accountability for results.
* Hire the right people for the roles of the job.
* Stronger team work, more successful collaboration with less friction.
* Clarity about roles reduces waste due to people having overlap of work or conflict about who should do what. 
* Helps filling a [job](#job-title) when a person leaves the organization.
* Business processes that use roles instead of job titles have less change volatility during reorganizations.

### Persons Affected
All employees.

### Minimum Viable Process Requirements
>Auditable: These requirements may be audited for evidence they were met.

- [x] As long as the following requirements are met, variation in the means to the end is okay for this process _(our default)_.
- [ ] **Critical process** that requires step-by-step compliance (_this is rare in leadership processes_).

1. Clear [roles](#role-gloss) and [responsibilities](#responsibilities-gloss) exist.
2. Communicated roles and responsibilities so employees are made aware of what is expected of them.

### Terms & Definitions
A common language helps us all mean the same thing.
The first use of a new term is linked from there to here.

<a name="job"></a>
**job**
:   A hired position **composed of roles**. 
Jobs can be composed of 1 or more roles.
A [job title](#job-title) refers to that job position. 
For example, manager.

**job description**
:   Sums up the roles (functions) and responsibilities (results, tasks) of the person who will be holding the position.
Often describe the knowledge, skills and/or abilities (competencies) required.
Job descriptions have specific requirements for regulatory compliance.

<a name="job-title"></a>
**job title**
:   The label your employer has given you.

<a name="role-gloss"></a>
**role**
:   Roles are not jobs.
The **function** assumed or part played by a person in a business process or situation.
A **set** of related responsibilities.
Roles are accountable for specific results (see responsibilities).
Think of a role as **a component of a job**.
Role names are descriptive of their set of responsibilities.
For example, a role of a receptionist is 'gatekeeper'.
It is possible for multiple people to have the same role, depending on what they do.

<a name="responsibilities-gloss"></a>
**responsibilities**
:   The more detailed **specifics of a role**. 
The set of specific **results, behaviors or tasks** people are accountable to demonstrate in order to fill a particular role.
Defines the work that needs to be performed in a role an employee is accountable for.
Format: start with an active verb, describe the task, and the intended result or outcome.
The priority of the tasks depends on leadership's priorities.
Defined results help develop performance indicators for measurement and feedback.
