# Clarify Roles & Responsibilities

* Leaders at all levels ensure clearly defined roles and their responsibilities.
* 
* Roles are not Jobs.
    - Jobs can be composed of 1 or more roles.
* Clarity about roles reduces waste due to people having overlap of work or conflict about who should do what.

## Standard Work Traceability Elements
Most employees just want to know how to do the process. 
So we get right to it in the top part (above this section).
Rather than make every person wade through all the traceability information, we have moved it to the bottom, for the less frequent users like the Quality Manager, and Auditors.

### Purpose
People need to be clear on [roles](#role-gloss) and [responsibilities](#responsibilities-gloss).

### Business Value (_why it matters_)
* Clear [roles](#role-gloss) and [responsibilities](#responsibilities-gloss) enable accountability for results.
* Hire the right people for the roles of the job.
* Stronger team work, more successful collaboration with less friction.
* Helps filling a [job](#job-title) when a person leaves the organization.

### Persons Affected
All employees.

### Minimum Viable Process Requirements
>Auditable: These requirements may be audited for evidence they were met.

<li><input type="checkbox" checked disabled> As long as the following requirements are met, variation in the means to the end is okay for this process _(our default)_</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled> **Critical** process that requires step-by-step compliance</li>

1. Clear [roles](#role-gloss) and [responsibilities](#responsibilities-gloss) exist.
2. Communicated roles and responsibilities so employees are made aware of what is expected of them.

### Terms & Definitions
A common language helps us all mean the same thing.
See the glossary at [url_link_goes_here](https://google.com). 
The first use of a new term is linked from here to that glossary.

<a name="job"></a>
**job**
:   A hired position **composed of roles**. A job title refers to that job position. For example, receptionist.

**job description**
:   Sums up the roles (functions) and responsibilities (results, tasks) of the person who will be holding the position.
Often describe the knowledge, skills and/or abilities (competencies) required.
Job descriptions have specific requirements for regulatory compliance.

<a name="job-title"></a>
**job title**
:   The label your employer has given you.

<a name="role-gloss"></a>
**role**
:   The **function** assumed or part played by a person in a business process or situation.
A **set** of related responsibilities.
Roles are accountable for specific results (see responsibilities).
Think of a role as **a component of a job**.
Role names are descriptive of their set of responsibilities.
For example, a role of a receptionist is 'gatekeeper'.
It is possible for multiple people to have the same role, depending on what they do.

>NOTE: Business processes that use roles instead of job titles have less change volatility during reorganizations.

<a name="responsibilities-gloss"></a>
**responsibilities**
:   The more detailed **specifics of a role**. 
The set of specific **results, behaviors or tasks** people are accountable to demonstrate in order to fill a particular role.
