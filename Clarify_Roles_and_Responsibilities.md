# Clarify Roles & Responsibilities

* Leaders at all levels ensure clearly defined roles and their responsibilities.
* Be sure roles help achieve the company vision and 1-year operating plan.
* Roles are accountable for specific results.
* Roles are not Jobs.
    - Jobs can be composed of 1 or more roles.
* Clarity about roles reduces waste due to people having overlap of work or conflict about who should do what.

## Standard Work Traceability Elements
Most employees just want to know how to do the process. 
So we get right to it in the top part (above this section).
Rather than make every person wade through all the traceability information, we have moved it to the bottom, for the less frequent users like the Quality Manager, and Auditors.
